# Perl
Collection of various algorithms in mathematics, machine learning, computer science, physics, etc implemented in Perl for educational purposes.  These are inspired by algorithms described in [The Algorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms) github.  The algorithms will be presented fully commented with integrated pod documentation in several forms, along witha description of the algorithm.

## A module

These are located in Algorithms\/\<TopicName\>/\<AlgorithmName\>\lib\/Algorithm\/\<TopicName\>/\<AlgorithmName\>.pm, and allow an object orientated utilisation of this module. Where the module already exists, that module  metacpan link and credit is offered.

## A standalone script

These have few dependancies and illustrate a Pure Perl implementation of the algorithm
  
## A low level version (e.g. XS, SPVM, or other high performance library)

These are for performance delivery but mainly use only perl advanced features to achieve this performance

## Methods that use external libraries

These are wrappers around readily avaiable compiled external libraries
